{% block tips %}
    <p>If you are encountering a 403 error unexpectedly, there are a few typical causes that are explained here:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none">
        <li><b>File Permissions.</b>  The user that is running the web server process does not have sufficient permissions to read the file that is being accessed.</li>
        <li><b>.htaccess</b> The .htaccess file can be used to deny access of certain resources to specific IP addresses or ranges, for example.</li>
    <li><b>Index File Does Not Exist</b> If the user is trying to access a directory that does not have a default index file, and directory listings are not enabled, the web server will return a 403 Forbidden error. </li>
    </ul>
